# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can add instructions to the `README.md` file to guide users on how to add the necessary environment variables to run the project locally:


## Setting up Environment Variables

Before running the project locally, you need to set up the following environment variables:

1. `TenantId`: The ID of the tenant.
2. `ClientId`: The client ID for authentication.
3. `ClientSecret`: The client secret for authentication.
4. `Resource`: The resource URL.
5. `Scope`: The scope for authentication.
6. `Password`: The password for authentication.
7. `AppUsername`: The username for authentication.

To set up these environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Open the system settings or the terminal on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the environment variables settings.
3. Add the following key-value pairs:
   - Key: `TenantId`
     - Value: The ID of the tenant.
   - Key: `ClientId`
     - Value: The client ID for authentication.
   - Key: `ClientSecret`
     - Value: The client secret for authentication.
   - Key: `Resource`
     - Value: The resource URL.
   - Key: `Scope`
     - Value: The scope for authentication.
   - Key: `Password`
     - Value: The password for authentication.
   - Key: `AppUsername`
     - Value: The username for authentication.
4. Save the changes.


Feel free to modify the instructions to match the specific requirements of your project.
